      BIND 9.14.0 is the first release of a new stable branch of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes
      that have been introduced, as well as features that have been
      deprecated or removed, since the last stable branch, 9.12.
    </p>

<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention.  BIND 9.14 contains new features added
      during the BIND 9.13 development process. Henceforth, the 9.14 branch
      will be limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed
      in the unstable 9.15 branch, and so forth.
    </p>

<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      Since 9.12, BIND has undergone substantial code refactoring and
      cleanup, and some very old code has been removed that was needed
      to support legacy platforms which are no longer supported by their
      vendors and for which ISC is no longer able to perform quality
      assurance testing.  Specifically, workarounds for old versions of
      UnixWare, BSD/OS, AIX, Tru64, SunOS, TruCluster and IRIX have been
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On UNIX-like systems, BIND now requires support for POSIX.1c
      threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
      IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
      C compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORM.md</code>
      file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
      platform compiler and system libraries provide the above features,
      BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
      development team will generally accept patches that add support
      for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of BIND 9.14, the BIND development team has also made cryptography
      (i.e., TSIG and DNSSEC) an integral part of the DNS server.  The
      OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
      platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
      cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
      still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
      and random number generation.

	<p>
	  A recent change in the <code class="filename">named.conf</code> parser
	  resulted in <span class="command"><strong>allow-update</strong></span> being treated as a
	  configuration error when set at the <span class="command"><strong>options</strong></span> or
	  <span class="command"><strong>view</strong></span> level. This is not a secure configuration
	  and the use of the option in this manner is ill-advised. However,
	  in this release it should have been treated as a warning rather
	  than a fatal error. This flaw was discovered too late to be
	  fixed in 9.14.0, but it will be corrected in the 9.14.1
	  maintenance release: global <span class="command"><strong>allow-update</strong></span> will
	  again be permitted, but a warning will be logged.

	  Task manager and socket code have been substantially modified.
	  The manager uses per-cpu queues for tasks and network stack runs
	  multiple event loops in CPU-affinitive threads. This greatly
	  improves performance on large systems, especially when using
	  multi-queue NICs.
	</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Support for QNAME minimization was added and enabled by default
	  in <span class="command"><strong>relaxed</strong></span> mode, in which BIND will fall back
	  to normal resolution if the remote server returns something
	  unexpected during the query minimization process. This default
	  setting might change to <span class="command"><strong>strict</strong></span> in the future.
	</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  A new <span class="command"><strong>plugin</strong></span> mechanism has been added to allow
	  extension of query processing functionality through the use of
	  external libraries. The new <code class="filename">filter-aaaa.so</code>
	  plugin replaces the <span class="command"><strong>filter-aaaa</strong></span> feature that
	  was formerly implemented as a native part of BIND.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The plugin API is a work in progress and is likely to evolve
	  as further plugins are implemented. [GL #15]

	  A new secondary zone option, <span class="command"><strong>mirror</strong></span>,
	  enables <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to serve a transferred copy
	  of a zone's contents without acting as an authority for the
	  zone. A zone must be fully validated against an active trust
	  anchor before it can be used as a mirror zone. DNS responses
	  from mirror zones do not set the AA bit ("authoritative answer"),
	  but do set the AD bit ("authenticated data"). This feature is
	  meant to facilitate deployment of a local copy of the root zone,
	  as described in RFC 7706. [GL #33]

	  BIND now can be compiled against the <span class="command"><strong>libidn2</strong></span>
	  library to add IDNA2008 support.  Previously, BIND supported
	  IDNA2003 using the (now obsolete and unsupported)
	  <span class="command"><strong>idnkit-1</strong></span> library.

<li class="listitem">

	  To disable this feature, add
	  <span class="command"><strong>root-key-sentinel no;</strong></span> to

<li class="listitem">

	  When built on Linux, BIND now requires the <span class="command"><strong>libcap</strong></span>
	  library to set process privileges.  The adds a new compile-time
	  dependency, which can be met on most Linux platforms by installing the
	  <span class="command"><strong>libcap-dev</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>libcap-devel</strong></span>
	  package. BIND can also be built without capability support by using
	  <span class="command"><strong>configure --disable-linux-caps</strong></span>, at the cost of some
	  loss of security.

	  the name space at or below the machine names identified
	  in the respective principals.

      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  The new configure option <span class="command"><strong>--enable-fips-mode</strong></span>
	  can be used to make BIND enable and enforce FIPS mode in the
	  OpenSSL library.  When compiled with such option the BIND will
	  refuse to run if FIPS mode can't be enabled, thus this option
	  must be only enabled for the systems where FIPS mode is available.

	  Two new configuration options <span class="command"><strong>min-cache-ttl</strong></span> and

	  administrator to override the minimum TTL in the received DNS records
	  (positive caching) and for storing the information about non-existent
	  records (negative caching).  The configured minimum TTL for both
	  configuration options cannot exceed 90 seconds.

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  The new <span class="command"><strong>answer-cookie</strong></span> option, if set to
	  <code class="literal">no</code>, prevents <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> from
	  returning a DNS COOKIE option to a client, even if such an
	  option was present in the request.  This is only intended as
	  a temporary measure, for use when <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span>
	  shares an IP address with other servers that do not yet
	  support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch between servers on the same
	  address is not expected to cause operational problems, but the
	  option to disable COOKIE responses so that all servers have the
	  same behavior is provided out of an abundance of caution.
	  DNS COOKIE is an important security mechanism, and this option
	  should not be used to disable it unless absolutely necessary.

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Workarounds for servers that misbehave when queried with EDNS
	  have been removed, because these broken servers and the
	  workarounds for their noncompliance cause unnecessary delays,
	  increase code complexity, and prevent deployment of new DNS
	  features. See <a class="link" href="https://dnsflagday.net" target="_top">https://dnsflagday.net</a>
	  for further details.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In particular, resolution will no longer fall back to
	  plain DNS when there was no response from an authoritative
	  server.  This will cause some domains to become non-resolvable
	  without manual intervention.  In these cases, resolution can
	  be restored by adding <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clauses for the
	  offending servers, specifying <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span> or
	  <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>, depending on the specific
	  noncompliance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To determine which <span class="command"><strong>server</strong></span> clause to use, run
	  the following commands to send queries to the authoritative
	  servers for the broken domain:
	</p>
<div class="literallayout"><p><br>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec<br>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec +nocookie<br>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +noedns<br>
</p></div>
	<p>
	  If the first command fails but the second succeeds, the
	  server most likely needs <span class="command"><strong>send-cookie no</strong></span>.
	  If the first two fail but the third succeeds, then the server
	  needs EDNS to be fully disabled with <span class="command"><strong>edns no</strong></span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please contact the administrators of noncompliant domains
	  and encourage them to upgrade their broken DNS servers. [GL #150]

	  Previously, it was possible to build BIND without thread support
	  for old architectures and systems without threads support.
